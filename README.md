## üéÆ Controls

| Key            | Action                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Mouse Drag** | Spawn a new ball with velocity   |
| `1 - 9`        | Change ball radius (size)        |
| `SPACE`        | Toggle energy loss on collisions |
| `P`            | Pause / Unpause simulation       |
| `A`            | Add gravity                      |
| `S`            | Subtract gravity                 |
| `R`            | Reset Screen                     |
| `Q`            | Exit application                 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pistachioczar/Physics-Engine.git
    cd Physics-Engine
```
2. **Run JAR File in /out/artifacts

## Bugs to be fixed

- The particles will gain a little bit of velocity when no energy loss mode is on.
- Particles will get jittery and not rest when gravity is high.
